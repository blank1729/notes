# Notes

This repo contains notes on things I learned and the notes contains links to resources(books, courses, articles,...). Most of the resources are free(I believe that education should be free and buying a course or a book in **most cases** is like buying sand in desert)

I am not the smartest or anything, In fact I am pretty stupid. So if you find any mistakes, please let me via __ (email) or sending a pull request.
